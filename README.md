# RiceTissueX
To systematically dissect the direction and magnitude of cis-regulatory sequence effects on gene transcription in rice, we integrated ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data from 22 tissues and organs of the *japonica* rice cultivar Nipponbare and developed **RiceTissueX**, a deep learning framework composed of three functionally complementary submodels. RiceTissueX jointly predicts the regulatory direction (activation or repression), effect size, and tissue specificity of candidate cis-regulatory sequences, and further supports in silico perturbation analysis of regulatory elements, providing computational guidance for precise genome editing targeting cis-regulatory elements.
